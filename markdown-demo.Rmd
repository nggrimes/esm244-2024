```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Hashtags control headers

### More hastags lower the header level

#### Small headers

We can type normal paragraphs like we do in any word processor. Admittedly the grammar and spell check is not as robust by default. Make sure to separate paragraphs by a line drop with the enter/return key

## Easily integrate code with Rmarkdown

```{r}
# code chunks work just like individual R scripts
# When knitted, all code chunks put add together
library(tidyverse)

mpg<-mtcars |> 
  group_by(cyl) |> 
  summarize(mean_mpg=mean(mpg))

mpg

aov_out<-aov(mpg~cyl,data=mtcars) |> 
  summary()

fval=aov_out[[1]]$`F value`[1]
pval=aov_out[[1]]$`Pr(>F)`[1]
```

We can type results directly into text output with inline code.

There is a significant difference in mean miles per gallon between the number of cylinders in a car (F-value=`r round(fval,3)`,p-value= `r signif(pval,3)`).

## Embed figures into the output directly

```{r}

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, size = disp)) +
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw()
```

## Style edits

*Italics works with asterisk*

**Bold works with double asterisks**

1.  Make lists
2.  Numbered
    a.   Sub bullets in option with two tabs

-   Bulleted lists
-   Work just with dots
    - Sub bullets
